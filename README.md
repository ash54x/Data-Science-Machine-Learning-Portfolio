# Machine-Learning-for-Data-Science-DSCI-552

This repository contains coursework from DSCI 552: Machine Learning for Data Science, a graduate-level course at USC. The class focused on both theoretical foundations and practical applications of machine learning, with a strong emphasis on hands-on problem solving using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Topics covered include supervised and unsupervised learning, regression, classification, decision trees, ensemble methods, dimensionality reduction, neural networks, SVMs, and probabilistic models.

Each folder contains a homework assignment that showcases data exploration, model building, and evaluation using real-world datasets. These assignments reflect my ability to apply core ML algorithms, perform error analysis, and communicate insights through code and visualizations.

Homework Concepts

- Homework 1: Linear regression, gradient descent, and error metrics

- Homework 2: Logistic regression, classification, and performance evaluation

- Homework 3: Decision trees, pruning, and ensemble methods

- Homework 5: Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical), PCA, dimensionality reduction

- Homework 6: Neural networks and backpropagation

- Homework 7: Probabilistic reasoning, HMMs, and the EM algorithm

- Homework 8: Naive Bayes, SVMs, and boosting techniques

This project highlights my practical understanding of machine learning techniques and my ability to implement, interpret, and communicate results clearlyâ€”skills essential for a data science or machine learning role.
