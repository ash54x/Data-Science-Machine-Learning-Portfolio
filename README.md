# Data Science / Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science and Machine Learning portfolio! This repository showcases a curated collection of projects and coursework developed during my graduate-level studies in data science at USC. Each subfolder contains well-documented, reproducible code designed to highlight technical skills, data manipulation capabilities, and a deep understanding of machine learning workflows.

The content reflects hands-on experience and conceptual mastery gained through two core courses:

1. Computational Thinking and Data Science:
This course focused on developing a computational mindset to solve data-driven problems. Concepts include:

- Data representation and transformation

- Relational algebra and SQL for data querying

- Graph theory and network data analysis

- MapReduce and large-scale data processing

- Algorithmic problem solving using Python


2. Machine Learning for Data Science: 
This course provided a rigorous foundation in modern machine learning techniques and their applications to real-world problems. Concepts include:

- Supervised learning (linear models, decision trees, ensembles)

- Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction)

- Model selection, evaluation, and cross-validation

- Optimization and regularization techniques

- Neural networks and deep learning fundamentals
