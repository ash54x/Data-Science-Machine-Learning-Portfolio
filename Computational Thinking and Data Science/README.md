# Computational Thinking and Data Science

The course emphasized real-world data analysis, statistical modeling, machine learning, and responsible data science practices using Python.
Tools and skills that were used in these assignments included Python, data wrangling, EDA, statistical inference, classification, machine learning, project design, reproducibility, and ethics in data science.

Homework Summaries:
- HW1: Applied Bayes' Theorem to model real-world diagnostic testing scenarios using conditional probability.

- HW2: Cleaned and wrangled messy datasets using pandas, joins, reshaping, and handling missing data.
- HW3: Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) through visualizataions and statistical summaries.
- HW4: Built and interpreted linear regression models for predictive analysis and inference.
- HW5: Developed and evaluated classification models including logistic regression, KNN, and decision trees.
- HW6: Completed an end-to-end capstone project with data cleaning, modeling, and results communication.
- HW7: Analyzed real-world tech case studies, identifying data challenges, proposing solutions, and addressing ethical considerations.
- HW8: Designed a complete data science project plan, detailing workflow, preprocessing, and feasibility analysis.
